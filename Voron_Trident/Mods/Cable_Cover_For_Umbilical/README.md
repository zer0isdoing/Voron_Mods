# Cable Cover For Umbilical
 
 This is cable cover on A drive for [Umbilical Strain Relief Mod](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%202/2.4/Voron2.4_umbilical_strain_relief).
 The Umbilical mod is not designed Trident at first place, that's why the cable cover in the mod's repository is not compatible with Trident's A drive.
